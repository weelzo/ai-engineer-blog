# Fine-tuning LLMs: Best Practices

Fine-tuning large language models requires careful consideration of various factors. Here are some best practices:

## Dataset Preparation

```python
def prepare_dataset(texts, labels):
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
    return [
        {"input_ids": tokenizer(text).input_ids, "label": label}
        for text, label in zip(texts, labels)
    ]
```

## Training Configuration

Setting the right hyperparameters is crucial for successful fine-tuning.
